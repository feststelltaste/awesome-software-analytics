## Influential Papers

This section lists important papers from which Software Analytics has emerged.

- [Thomas Zimmermann, Peter Weisgerber, Stephan Diehl, and Andreas Zeller: Mining Version Histories to Guide Software Changes (2004)](https://www.st.uni-trier.de/~diehl/pubs/icse04.pdf) - A real classic about the idea of using software version control systems to guide software changes (awarded with the ICSE 10 Years Most Influential Paper Award 2014).
- [Tim Menzies, Christian Bird, Thomas Zimmermann, Wolfram Schulte, and Ekrem Kocaganeli: The inductive software engineering manifesto: principles for industrial data mining (2011)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.352.9342&rep=rep1&type=pdf) - Makes you aware of various aspects that you have to consider if you want to implement Software Analytics in the industry.
- [Andrew Begel and Thomas Zimmermann: Analyze this! 145 questions for data scientists in software engineering (2013)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MSR-TR-2013-111.pdf) - a kind of meta-level paper about the questions that arise during software development which may be answered with Software Analytics.
- [Ahmed E. Hassan and Tao Xie: Software intelligence: the future of mining software engineering data (2010)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221560786_Software_Intelligence_The_Future_of_Mining_Software_Engineering_Data_ABSTRACT) - discusses (among other topics) which types of software data can be used with existing data mining techniques.
- [Tim Menzies and Thomas Zimmermann. Software Analytics: So What? (2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260649759_Software_Analytics_So_What) - contains a critical discussion on how far has Software Analytics got in the recent years.

## Books
