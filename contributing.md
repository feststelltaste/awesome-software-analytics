# Contribution Guidelines

This awesome list is of course open for your ideas!

## Your Contribution

Feel free to add any ideas via a Pull Request ([here is a guide for this](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md)).
If you are unsure, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/feststelltaste/awesome-software-analytics/issues/new) to discuss your idea.

### Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Your addition should not be already in the list.
- You give a short description or comment about the resource.
- Your addition belongs to an already existing section or adds a new one if needed.
- Your change respects the [decisions made so far](decisions.md) and the ["awesome manifesto"](#awesome-manifesto).

Thank you for your suggestions!


### Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it.
There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one.
If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
